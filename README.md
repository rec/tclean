Clean audio practice files


## Points to deliver

1. watch a directory
2. wait until all files are copied
3. process
4. upload mpy to server.swirly.com automagically
5. write a log

Also:

watch /Volumes/ and sync using rsync


Process is this:

* convert master.wav to m4a and put it in a directory by year/month/day
* zip the whole recording and stash it somewhere.
